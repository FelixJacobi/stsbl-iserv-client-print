stsbl-iserv-client-print (17.04.08-1) experimental; urgency=medium
  
  [ Felix Jacobi ]
  * setup_printer: Delete only printers with the location 'iserv'.
    This should prevent deletion of local printers and should include 
    old zombie printers which are already deleted on the server.

stsbl-iserv-client-print (17.04.08-0) experimental; urgency=medium
  
  [ Felix Jacobi ]
  * setup_printer:
    - Improved reliability.
    - Added support to parse printers.json.
    - Currently do not delete all CUPS printers to avoid deletion of local printers 
      (this may create printer zombies, but this will be addressed in a later update).
